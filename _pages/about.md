Hi~ I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)(CUHK), supervised by [Prof.Jiaya JIA](https://jiaya.me/home) and [Prof.Bei YU](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in 2024 from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scut.edu.cn/cs/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/)(SCUT).

My current research interests mainly focus on large language models, multi-modality models, and their adaptation to complex real-world scenarios.
